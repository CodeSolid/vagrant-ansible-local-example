# vagrant-ansible-local-example

This is a simple example showing how to configure vagrant to use the ansible-local provisioner.

## Requirements:

* Vagrant
* VirtualBox

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/CodeSolid/vagrant-ansible-local-example.git
cd vagrant-ansible-local-example.git
vagrant up
```

Give the VM time to come up and you should be able to verify it came up correctly on your host machine at http://localhost:8080.

## More details:

The code's pretty simple, but we walk through some of the details in the [accompanying article](http://codesolid.com/posts/vagrant-ansible-local/).
